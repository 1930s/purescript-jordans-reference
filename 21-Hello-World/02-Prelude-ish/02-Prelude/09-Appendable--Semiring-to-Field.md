# Appendable - Semiring to Field

These can be figured out by just looking at the laws. However, the only example I can think of that fits everything up to a Field is `Int` or `Number`. Hence, I'm not sure how often one uses these and if they only exist in Prelude so that common number operations (addition/multiplication/subtraction/division, gcd, lcm, etc.) are already provided for you.

In other words, I need to research these more, mainly by finding other domains that are familiar to me that would have instances for these type classes.

Still, their documentation is below:

- [Ring](https://pursuit.purescript.org/packages/purescript-prelude/4.1.0/docs/Data.Ring)
- [CommutativeRing](https://pursuit.purescript.org/packages/purescript-prelude/4.1.0/docs/Data.CommutativeRing)
- [EuclideanRing](https://pursuit.purescript.org/packages/purescript-prelude/4.1.0/docs/Data.EuclideanRing)
