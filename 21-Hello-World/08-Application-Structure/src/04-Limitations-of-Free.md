# Limitations of Free

In this video, John De Goes explains what some of the limitations of the Free monad are...
- parallelism
- racing
- alternatives
- e.g. stuff one can't model using just the Monad structure of Free

... and how one can 'hack' those into it. A non-hacky solution is possible, but writing in such a 'language' would likely require a new programming language entirely.
