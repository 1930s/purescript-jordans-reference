I'm not yet sure what will go here, but this seemed like a good place to put this link:
- [Introducing Haskell to a Company](https://alasconnect.github.io/blog/posts/2018-10-02-introducing-haskell-to-a-company.html), which can equally apply to Purescript

Once you reached this point, you should read through this book: [Lenses for the Mere Mortal: Purescript Edition](https://leanpub.com/lenses)
