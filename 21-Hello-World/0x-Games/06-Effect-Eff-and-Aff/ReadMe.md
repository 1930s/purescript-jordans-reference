# Effect, Eff, and Aff

Since `Effect` has already been explained, our focus will be on `Aff` and its relation and usage with `Effect`. In this folder, we'll peel back the covers of `Node.ReadLine.CleanerInterface` and cover more of `Aff`.

However, `Aff` will not be covered in its full complexity.
