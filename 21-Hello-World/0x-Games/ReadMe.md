## Console Lessons

After one introduces the "Hello World" app in a language tutorial/textbook, they usually introduce additional programming concepts by writing a console-based program, a program that can receive user input and that outputs something based on that input. We will follow suit.

At times, we'll hide some types/functions from you, so that you can focus on learning rather than explaining why/how something works. If you are curious to look at it later, the helper code can be found in the "Helper-Code" folder.
