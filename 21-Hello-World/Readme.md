# Hello World

This folder will document everything necessary to create a simple "hello world" program in Purescript, along with tests. It will cover the following libraries:
- Prelude
- Quick Check
- Quick spec
- Effect
- Console

## Other Learning Resources

Besides ths repo, we have a few choices in terms of understanding functional programming. Since Purescript is heavily inspired by and very similar to Haskell, most of these refer to Haskell learning resources. Note: these are not necessarily "either x or y or z" choices but could be "X supplemented by Y with a little bit of Z").

| Action | Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Read the documentation and source code for a type class and a few data types' implementations of said type classes | Free | Takes a lot of time; requires intuition to understand type class' usefulness / relation to others.
| Read the relevant chapters from [Learn You a Haskell for Great Good](http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters) | Free | Doesn't teach things from a principled approach (e.g. laws aren't always explained); read elsewhere that it's "outdated"
| Read through some of the free course materials taught by someone well informed about Haskell [here (you'll need to scroll towards the bottom)](https://github.com/bitemyapp/learnhaskell) | Free; more principled explanations | Looking at just slides without hearing someone teach using them is not usually as clear as when someone does teach using them or reading through a textbook on the same matter.
| Read and do the exercises from [The Haskell Book](http://haskellbook.com/) | The "standard" for teaching Haskell and FP concepts in general: good explanations; good exercises; teaches "programming in the small" | Costs money; costs time; the exercises will stretch you
| Read and do the exercises from [Haskell Cookbook](https://leanpub.com/haskellcookbook), and then its follow up book [Haskell Cookbook 2](https://leanpub.com/haskellcookbook2) | Free/Cheap; simpler than the Haskell book; gets to ideas faster; teaches "programming in the large" | May be harder for a new beginner (I haven't read it yet)
| Watch the Intro to FP course on edX.org [here](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-functional-programming-delftx-fp101x-0) | Free (or paid) | (Haven't done it so I don't know)
