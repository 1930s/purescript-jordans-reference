# The Expression Problem

## Brief Summary

The [Expression Problem](http://www.daimi.au.dk/~madst/tool/papers/expression.txt) can be summarized into three ideas:
> The goal is to define a data type by cases, where
> 1. one can add new cases to the data type and
> 2. (one can add) new functions over the data type,
> 3. without recompiling existing code, and
> 4. while retaining static type safety.

| | Pre-existing compiled function | Function is added
| - | - | - |
| Pre-existing compiled data type | All languages | FP: Add a function<br> OO: ???
| Data type is added | FP: ???<br>OO: Add a subclass | Problem's Solution<br><br>FP: ???<br>OO: ??? |

## A Solution to the Expression Problem

The `Free` Monad is one way to solve the expression problem in an FP language. This is very clearly explained in the paper, [Data Types Ã  la carte](http://www.cs.ru.nl/~W.Swierstra/Publications/DataTypesALaCarte.pdf), which synthesized a number of known-at-the-time-of-writing ideas into a working solution.

However, I will still try to explain this concept using a different route. Why? Because I want to see what other problems arise in that process (bottom-up approach) and therefore learn more than what this paper explains. The rest of this folder's contents achieve that goal.

While you, the reader, can just read the paper and ignore the rest of this folder's contents, there are some lessons to be learned here that will not be covered elsewhere:
- Nested Eithers
- Variant

The next folder will show **how** to write code using the `Free` Monad.
