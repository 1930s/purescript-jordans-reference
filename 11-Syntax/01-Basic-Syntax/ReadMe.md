Read through these files in their order. To further grasp the concept, write your own version of the code and see if it still compiles by running:
```bash
pulp --psc-package build

To see what the documentation looks like, run this command:
```bash
pulp --psc-package docs
```
Then, open the file, `./generated-docs/Syntax/Documentation.md`, to see what it outputs.
