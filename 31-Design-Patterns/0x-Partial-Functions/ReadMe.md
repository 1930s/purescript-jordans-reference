# Partial Functions

This folder will use the problem of dividing two integers to demonstrate the four different ways one can handle partial functions in Purescript:
- via `Partial`
- via `Maybe a`
- via `Either String a`
- via `Either CustomErrorType a`

It tries to not use any other libraries beyond that to which the user has already been exposed, unless it is the topic being explained. The code demonstrated here is likely not the best way to code a program that seeks to solve the given problem. Rather, it uses the simplest possible problem (divison) to demonstrate how to handle errors.

## Compilation Instruction

Start the REPL, import the file's module, and pass in different arguments to the function to see what happens
