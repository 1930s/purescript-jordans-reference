# Ecosystem

This folder will do 2 things:
- Document 'library stacks': libraries that are often used together to solve some problem.
- Organize Purescript libraries by tag (e.g. Bindings, Typeclasses, UI, data types, etc.)
- Map out the type classes' relationships.

Since this repo is meant for my learning (with your benefit), it will center around my coding interests (and not yours, unfortunately).
