# Purescript

This folder seeks to include all resources necessary for learning enough of Purescript (version 0.12.0) to use it to solve most programming problems:

- Syntax - how to use syntax to write code in Purescript
- Libraries
    - Prelude - the library that defines basic types and whatnot
- Design Patterns - commonly-used patterns to solve problems

## Guidelines

- Git clone this repo
- Read the pages in order, including folders (i.e. a depth-first graph search).
    - In other words, starting with `purescript/01-Syntax/`, one should read the `00-Comments.purs` file first, then the `01-Data-and-Types.purs` file, then read all the files inside the folder, `02-Values-and-Functions` in their order. (If a topic was deemed too long in content to put into one file, the topic was turned into a folder that has a file for each subtopic.)
