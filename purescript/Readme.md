# Purescript

This folder seeks to include all resources necessary for learning enough of Purescript (version 0.12.0) to use it to solve most programming problems:

- Basic Syntax - how to use basic syntax to write code in Purescript
- The Prelude library - An explanation of the `purescript-prelude` library used everywhere to define basic types and whatnot
- Intermediate Syntax - how to use more advanced syntax to write code in Purescript
- Intermediate Concepts - Patterns used in functional programming to solve common problems

## Guidelines

- The pages are meant to be read in order, including folders (i.e. a depth-first graph search).

In other words, starting with `01_Basic_Syntax`, one should read `01_Data_and_Types.purs` first, then read all the files inside the folder, `02_Values_and_Functions`, and then read the file `03_TypeClasses.purs`. (If a topic was deemed to long in content to stick into one file, the file was turned into a folder with the same name and its sections were turned into files contained in that folder.)
